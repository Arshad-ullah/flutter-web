StateFull Widgets:

Stateful Widgets are dynamic widgets. They can be updated during runtime based on user action or data change.
 Stateful Widgets have an internal state and can re-render if the input data changes 
or if Widget's state changes. For Example: Checkbox, Radio Button,
 Slider are Stateful Widgets.

 Stateful widgets have a mutable state and they are mutable and can be drawn multiple times within its lifetime.


 Basically they are the widgets which they can change the heir state multiple

 times and can be redrawn on to the screen any number of times while the app is in action.

 They are dynamic. To create a Stateful widget, we have to override the createState() method,

  which returns the state of the widget.

 Forexample: CheckBox,Button,


 import 'package:flutter/material.dart';


 class Testing extends StatefulWidget {
   const Testing({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

   @override
   _TestingState createState() => _TestingState();
 }

 class _TestingState extends State<Testing> {
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return Container();
   }
 }
